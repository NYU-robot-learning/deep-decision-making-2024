This course serves as a graduate-level introduction to RL, with an emphasis on applications and recent research. Students will be introduced to a broad set of topics in RL: Basic formalisms; Exploration vs exploitation; Imitation learning; Model-free RL; Model-based control and planning; Unsupervised learning for RL; Applications to games, robotics, industry; Current frontiers. This course will involve several coding home-works where you will implement various algorithms, and a final project.
