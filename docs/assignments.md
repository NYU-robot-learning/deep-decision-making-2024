## Collaboration Policy
The work you submit for assignments is expected to be entirely your own without collaboration. For the assignments, we will use a “mission command” approach. This means that we will tell you what we want you to do, not how. It is known to foster creative problem solving skills. In practice, this means that you can solve the problems using any means at your disposal (if you are comfortable with them) in addition to those taught in this class.
